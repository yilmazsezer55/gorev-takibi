## Core Features:

- Task List Display: Display tasks in a tabular format on the main page, with columns for Task Key, Task Type, Task Name, City/Administration, Progress, Status, Analysis/Test Link Key, and Progress Notes.
- Edit Button: Implement an 'Edit' button for each task row, which opens a modal for editing task details.
- Edit Modal: Design a modal that opens in the center of the screen to allow editing of task details. Ensure it is responsive, with a maximum width and height, scrollable content, and animations for opening and closing.
- Edit Form: Create a form within the modal for editing task details. Use a grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Input Fields: Implement input fields for each task detail, including text inputs, dropdown menus, and a slider for progress. The 'Analysis/Test Link Key' input should only be active when the status is 'TAMAMLANDI'.
- Buttons: Include 'Cancel' and 'Save' buttons in the modal, aligned appropriately for different screen sizes.
- Edit Save: Implement functionality to save the edited task details and update the main page table accordingly. Ensure the modal closes without saving if 'Cancel' or the close (X) button is clicked.
